# dedup

This repo contains a class that contains methods that return an array of random integers without duplicates. The first method uses an ArrayList and checks for a duplicate before adding it to the list. This retains the original ordering of the numbers (minus the duplicates). The second method uses a HashSet. Since a Set does not contain duplicates, no check for a duplicate is needed before adding the number; it is simply not added if it already exists. This method does not retain the ordering though. The third method uses a LinkedHashSet which retains the ordering. A fourth method was added that returns an array in numerical order.

To answer question 5, "What are the positives and negatives of your solution?" and "Can you implement it another way so as to avoid the negatives?". The positives are that the implementations are pretty straight forward and are easy to write in a functional programming style, without side effects. The original array is never altered. For negatives, there is a lot of duplicate code, so this can be implemented in a way to isolate the duplicate code and increase maintainability. Also, as far as performance goes, it was found that, on average, the LinkedHashSet performed nearly twice as long as either the ArrayList or HashSet. If the main desire is to have the array retain the original order, then the ArrayList looks to be the least expensive option.
